# node-red-ui-node-mylittleuinode

A Node-Red dashboard ui node to help you create your own ui node.

The intention of this node is to show the user the how/where/what of creating a custom ui node.
All of the code in the `.html` and `.js` files are commented extensively and places the key sections of code into blocks to be edited.


## Inputs
Send `msg.payload` to this node to change the text displayed in the textbox.

## Outputs
Node will send textbox value as `msg.payload` when the textbox has focus, and the user presses the `Enter` key.
