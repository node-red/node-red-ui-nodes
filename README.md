Additional nodes for Node-RED Dashboard

This repository contains a few example extra Dashboard Widgets for the [Node-RED
Dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard) project - along with documentation that should be enough to help you create your own. In order to work they require both [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) and Node-RED-Dashboard to be installed.

Most widgets will be published as their own standalone npm packages called node-red-node-ui-*something*, rather than as part of this repo. If you create your own nodes please try to call them node-red-contrib-ui-*something*.

A basic knowledge of Javascript is required, and the UI itself uses Angular version 1 and jQuery, so a knowledge of, or a willingness to learn, some of these would be an advantage.

Pull requests to help add documentation and to add clarity are most welcome - but please read the [Contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
